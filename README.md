# GULP

GULP is a program for performing a variety of types of simulation on materials using boundary conditions of 0-D (molecules and clusters), 1-D (polymers), 2-D (surfaces, slabs and grain boundaries), or 3-D (periodic solids). The focus of the code is on analytical solutions, through the use of lattice dynamics, where possible, rather than on molecular dynamics. A variety of force fields can be used within GULP spanning the shell model for ionic materials, molecular mechanics for organic systems, the embedded atom model for metals and the reactive REBO potential for hydrocarbons. Analytic derivatives are included up to at least second order for most force fields, and to third order for many.

GULP is available for free for academic use by anyone with a valid University email account. To access the code please go to the appropriate tab and "register". The code is provided "as is" and without support. Any questions regarding the use of the code can be posted at the [user forum](http://matsci.org/) if not already covered in previous topics. Bug reports and registration queries can be sent to gulpcode at curtin.edu.au, and we will try to respond as soon as is possible.
