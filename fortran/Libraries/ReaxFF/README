ReaxFF library files:
---------------------

This directory contains ReaxFF library files in the original ffield format used by Adri van Duin's original code. 
These can now be read into GULP directly using the "reaxff_library" option.

At the end of each are comments giving test results performed using GULP and the original ReaxFF code. 
Where possible, values are compared against some of those available in the original reference for the parameters. 
Any descrepancies are also highlighted. Aside from properties of structures, such as optimised lattice parameters
the components of the ReaxFF energy are compared between ReaxFF and GULP for one or more structures. 

NB: GULP introduces a number of changes to the ReaxFF formalism for smoothness, such as tapering bond orders to zero at the tolerance. 
    This leads to (usually) small changes in the energy and properties. To reproduce the original ReaxFF behaviour the following changes can be made to the GULP input:
    1) Add the keyword "strict" which removes tapering
    2) Add the option "reaxfftol 0.001 0.005". The first tolerance is provided in the ffield file and so can be set accordingly. 
       The second tolerance is for the valence energy and in GULP defaults to 0.001, but was 0.005 in the original code.

In addition to the ffield files, the GULP input files used for testing are also made available in this directory.
